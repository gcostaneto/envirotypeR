Description: A software package has been developed to facilitate enviromics research in plant and animal science, with a specific emphasis on genetic improvement (breeding) and ecology. 
    This comprehensive tool is designed to support various stages of the research process, including the steps of
    (1) Data Collection, Utilizing remote sensing tools and geographic datasets.
    (2) Data Processing, Performing computations for a diverse range of environmental indexes, synthetic environmental features, and ensuring data quality control.
    (3) Envirotyping Studies, Conducting analyses that combine environmental factors with typing information, encompassing the characterization of envirotypes in terms of frequency and distribution.
    (4) Modeling, Fitting spatial or climate-enriched models for applied quantitative genetics and conducting research on phenotype prediction.
    This software package aims to stYreamline and enhance the efficiency of research activities in the field of enviromics.
